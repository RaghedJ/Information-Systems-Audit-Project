# Information-Systems-Audit-Project
As part of our Information Systems Audit course, our team conducted a comprehensive cybersecurity audit of a Java/MySQL-based Restaurant Management System. The system handles tasks like order processing, inventory tracking, customer data management, and billing—making security a top priority.

We evaluated the system against the Essential Cybersecurity Controls (ECC v2.0) issued by Saudi Arabia’s National Cybersecurity Authority. We focused on six critical subdomains:

- Cybersecurity Risk Management
- Asset Management
- Identity and Access Management
- Backup and Recovery Management
- Vulnerability Management
- Cybersecurity Incident and Threat Management

Key Contributions:

- Selecting and analyzing relevant ECC subdomains such as Risk Management, Identity & Access Management, and Backup & Recovery.
- Conducting hands-on audits of code, database structure, and authentication mechanisms.
- Identifying security weaknesses, including lack of encryption, hardcoded credentials, and missing access control policies.
- Developing clear, practical security recommendations and aligning them with industry standards.

This hands-on audit experience gave us a deeper understanding of secure software development, aligning academic knowledge with real-world cybersecurity practices.
